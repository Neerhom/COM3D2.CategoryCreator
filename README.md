# COM3D2.CategoryCreator

!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!!! 
Because of how game stores and reads save file data, ALL savefiles saved with this patcher active will be treated by the base game as invalid! 
Possible solutions for this issues is under investigation.

The patcher adds new menu categories and model slots, to extend maid customization.

List of added categories and associated models slots:

Head customization:

EYE2(folder_eye2, eye2) - none

The EYE2 (eye2, folder_eye2) is the same as normal eye categories(eye, folder_eye) and is intended for making maid with eye heterochromia. The initial release includes all eye menus from base game ported to it, and they affect right eye only. Mugen versions use EYE_R color.

Initial release includes all eye menus from base COM3D2 proted to this categoris, which affect maid right eye.

Body: 

Toenails(acctoenail) - acctoenail

Skintoon(skintoon) - none

The patcher also adds accnail models slot, for use in Nails/ネイル (accnail) category.

In addition, the patcher exposes Body category from base game, which enabled loading of bodymods from CM3D2 or created for COM3D2, with disregard of menu filename.

Initial release includes free-colored nails and toenails, and a basic toon mod.

Accessories:

Hand_L(acchandl) - acchandl

Hand_R(acchandr) - acchandr

Ears - ears

Hand_L and Hand_R are categories dedicated for hand items, and initial release includes dildos from base game.

Ears and horns categories are added to make ears and horns compatible with hats, without sacrificing any other category.
